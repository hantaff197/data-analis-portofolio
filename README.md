# Data Analyst Portofolio

Portfolio of learning outcomes from TripleTen, formerly Practicum's data analyst program. There are various learning subjects that support becoming a data analyst, such as data pre-processing, data analyzing, data visualization, data storytelling, etc. Project work is mainly done in Python with different libraries for each project.
